# Uhmong Us

This is my quite ambitious recreation of the game "Among Us", but in Python. 
I started this project in November 2020. 
I was inspired by my recent success within my [networking project](https://github.com/Lance-Easley/Networking) that allowed for multiplayer capabilites.
Ever since, I have been working on the project in bursts, influenced by my free-time.

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Progress (7/22/2021)

Right now, I am working in between shadow logic and tasks. 
As I work on the tasks, I am optimizing the shadow code.
I want to see if I can get the shadow limits to be circular instead of a rectangle as it is now.
My only concern is the performance hit it might take.

I have the tasks planned out in the [planning.png](https://github.com/Lance-Easley/Uhmong-Us/blob/main/images/planning.png) image, I just need to design and code the tasks in.
Once a task is built, I already have the interaction areas built up and put on the map. 
These areas are denoted by the yellow outlines drawn on the map.
