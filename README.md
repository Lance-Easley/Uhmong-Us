# Uhmong Us

This is my quite ambitious recreation of the game "Among Us", but in Python. 
I started this project in November 2020. 
I was inspired by my recent success within my [networking project](https://github.com/Lance-Easley/Networking) that allowed for multiplayer capabilites.
Ever since, I have been working on the project in bursts, influenced by my free-time.

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Progress (10/2/2022)

I've finished the tasks and most of the UI at this point. There will be a couple more UI elements to build for the imposter, as well as sabotages (aka imposter triggered tasks). Now that I'm onto role assignment, I can start working on imposter features, like sabotages, closing doors, etc.
