# Uhmong Us

This is my quite ambitious recreation of the game "Among Us", but in Python. 
I started this project in November 2020. 
I was inspired by my recent success within my [networking project](https://github.com/Lance-Easley/Networking) that allowed for multiplayer capabilites.
Ever since, I have been working on the project in bursts, influenced by my free-time.

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Roadmap

## Progress (8/6/2021)

The shadow system is now fully built (finally). 
Now I can focus entirely on making tasks.

I have the tasks planned out in the [planning.png](https://github.com/Lance-Easley/Uhmong-Us/blob/main/images/planning.png) image, I just need to design and code the tasks in.
Once a task is built, I already have the interaction areas built up and put on the map. 
These areas are denoted by the yellow outlines drawn on the map.
