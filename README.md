# Uhmong Us

This is my quite ambitious recreation of the game "Among Us", but in Python. 
I started this project in November 2020. 
I was inspired by my recent success within my [networking project](https://github.com/Lance-Easley/Networking) that allowed for multiplayer capabilites.
Ever since, I have been working on the project in bursts, influenced by my free-time.

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Progress (4/11/2022)

Progress has been slower recently due to life doing it's thing. I've got about half of the tasks done (yay). My main constraint is designing artwork, as I get bored with it quicker than anything lol.

I have the tasks planned out in the [planning.png](https://github.com/Lance-Easley/Uhmong-Us/blob/main/images/planning.png) image, I just need to design and code the rest of the tasks in.
